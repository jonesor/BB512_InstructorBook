# Geometric growth

This exercise explores the geometric growth model in discrete time steps, focusing on how different values of $\lambda$ affect population dynamics. It aims to develop students’ understanding of growth models, the effects of log transformations, and the limitations of simple models.

## Key Concepts:
- Geometric growth assumes constant $\lambda$, leading to exponential growth or decline.
- Plotting log-transformed population sizes allows easier visualisation of trends.
- Limitations of the model include the assumption of infinite resources and lack of environmental constraints.

## Model Answers

### 1. **How does the population size change with time for different values of $\lambda$?**
- For $\lambda > 1$, the population size increases exponentially.
- For $\lambda = 1$, the population size remains constant.
- For $\lambda < 1$, the population size decreases exponentially.

**Explanation**: The growth rate $\lambda$ drives the population’s exponential increase or decrease. $\lambda = 1$ represents equilibrium.

### 2. **Why is it useful to plot log-transformed population size?**
- Log-transformation converts exponential growth into a straight line, simplifying the interpretation of growth rates.

**Explanation**: Log-transformations linearise exponential relationships, allowing for easier interpretation of the growth rate, as the slope corresponds to $\log(\lambda)$.

### 3. **What are the limitations of the geometric growth model?**
- The model assumes infinite resources, no competition, or environmental constraints, making it unrealistic for real-world populations.

**Explanation**: Real-world populations face density-dependent factors and environmental stochasticity, which the geometric model does not account for.

### 4. **What would happen if we introduced a carrying capacity to this model?**
- The population would follow a logistic growth model, where growth slows as the population nears the carrying capacity.

**Explanation**: A carrying capacity introduces limits to population size, stabilising it after an initial period of exponential growth.

## Teaching Tips:

1. **Excel Guidance**: Ensure students understand how to perform log transformations and add trendlines.
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Clarify the assumptions of the model (no immigration, emigration, or environmental changes).
3. **Real-World Application**: Use examples like invasive species or epidemics to explain how geometric growth can be observed in certain scenarios.
4. **Class Discussion**: Engage students in discussions about how the model could be adapted to account for real-world variables like environmental factors or density dependence.
