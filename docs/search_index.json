Jones (Course Coordinator) 2024-09-14 1 This website and other course materials This website contains resources for instructors in BB512. We may not do ALL of these exercises, but you are welcome to do ones we miss in your own time. 1.1 Software We will use Excel and R/RStudio during this course. 1.1.1 Excel I expect you will already have Excel installed, so there is not much to say here. Be aware that Excel differs depending on the language it is localised in. For example, Danish vs. English. This means that some of the commands might differ between version. See here for examples. 1.1.2 R and RStudio R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software. RStudio is a user-friendly interface to talk to R, it cannot work if you have not got R installed. So, when you install these two programs, install R first, then RStudio. Already have them installed? I strongly recommend to update to the latest versions of R, which you can download here and RStudio Desktop, which you can find here.
